# Weather Prediction with Machine Learning

## 📋 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting weather type using (temperature, precipitation, humidity, etc.) using Machine Learning models. It leverages historical weather data to forecast future trends, enabling better decision-making for applications such as agriculture, disaster management, and transportation planning.

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Data Collection**: Gather historical weather data from reliable source.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to remove inconsistencies and prepare it for modeling.
- **Modeling**: Build and evaluate various machine learning models to predict weather parameters.

   - Source: https://github.com/Jey-krishna/Weatherclassificatiion-using-KNN/blob/main/weather_classification_data.csv
   - Tools: Python libraries like `pandas` and `requests` for scraping and handling data.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values, normalize data, and perform feature engineering.
   - Use tools like `NumPy`, `pandas`, and `scikit-learn`.

3. **Model Training**:
   - ML Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM for time series data.
   - Libraries: `scikit-learn`.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Use metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R² score to evaluate model performance.
